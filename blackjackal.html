      <h2>Not Just a Trainer. A Full Learning System.</h2>
      <p>Most blackjack apps quiz you on the chart. BlackJackal builds the decision-making instincts that hold up in a real game. Whether you're new to basic strategy or tightening up for high-volume sessions, every mode is designed to create reps that transfer.</p>
      <div class="feature-points">
        <div class="feature-point"><strong>Train Mode:</strong> Practice in multiple formats — Standard, EV Trainer, Full Hand, Weak Spots, and Situational drills — each designed to target a different layer of decision quality.</div>
        <div class="feature-point"><strong>Academy Mode:</strong> Long-form lessons explain the reasoning behind every move, from fundamental strategy to targeted hand type breakdowns, with guided drills to reinforce each concept.</div>
        <div class="feature-point"><strong>Progress Mode:</strong> A single dashboard tracking accuracy trends, weak hands, response speed, streaks, and EV leakage across every session you've played.</div>
        <div class="feature-point"><strong>Settings That Match Real Play:</strong> Adjust table rules and game conditions so your practice reflects the exact games you sit in.</div>
