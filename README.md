# Resnick Creations

This repository powers the **Resnick Creations portfolio hub** — a single place to showcase my products, current work, and upcoming releases.

Live site: **https://mresnick67.github.io/Resnick-Creations/index.html**

## Purpose

This repo is intentionally a **project hub**, not one standalone app.
It exists to:

- present my product portfolio with premium UX
- give each product a dedicated landing page
- centralize links to live products, beta access, and source repositories
- provide a clean public-facing home for ongoing work

## Featured Products

- **Feels Like** (Live on App Store)
  - Weather app focused on apparent temperature + practical daily guidance
- **Activate** (Coming Soon)
  - iOS workout tracker focused on fast logging and coaching-ready insights
- **Forecheck Fantasy** (Now in Beta in TestFlight)
  - Fantasy hockey decision platform for streamers, scans, and player-level analysis

## Site Structure
