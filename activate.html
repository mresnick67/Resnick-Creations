      <h2>Why Activate</h2>
      <p>Most fitness apps either overcomplicate logging or underdeliver on insight. Activate is designed to do both jobs well: make logging frictionless and make the data useful.</p>
      <p>The experience is being built around practical training behavior, not novelty UI.</p>
      <p class="section-note"><strong>Core principle:</strong> logging speed and trust first, then coaching intelligence layered on top.</p>
