        <h2>Why Forecheck Exists</h2>
        <p>Most fantasy workflows are fragmented: one app for box scores, another for ownership, another for league chatter, plus spreadsheets to tie it together.</p>
        <p>Forecheck gives managers one focused command center to discover streamers, track player direction, run custom scans, and make smarter adds with confidence.</p>

      <aside class="callout">
        <p><strong>Designed for:</strong> serious managers in active leagues who care about weekly edge and process quality.</p>

      <h2>Key Product Capabilities</h2>
      <div class="feature-points">
        <div class="feature-point">
          <strong>Streamer Score (0–100) that actually means something</strong><br />
          Forecheck ranks players with a position-aware score using recent production, deployment, peripherals, trend direction, and current availability. It’s built to surface practical pickup value, not just raw season totals.
        </div>
        <div class="feature-point">
          <strong>Create + monitor custom scans</strong><br />
          Managers can define scan rules (stat, comparator, threshold, window, and optional compare window), evaluate them instantly, then follow alert-enabled scans to catch new matches as they appear.
        </div>
        <div class="feature-point">
          <strong>Player-by-player decision breakdowns</strong><br />
          Every candidate can be inspected with rolling windows (L5/L10/L20/Season), trend context, and recent games so managers can validate the add before pulling the trigger.
